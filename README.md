# [Project Name] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [MANASA DINKAR'S TEAM]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [MANASA DINKAR] - [SNMIMT,MALIANKARA]

### Project Description
A calculator that helps students plan their bunks and still maintain the sacred 75% attendance. 
Because missing class is an art.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Students are tired of actually doing math to figure out how many classes they can bunk. Tragic.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A glorified calculator that tells you how many classes you can skip before the system kicks you out. No math, just vibes.

### Project Documentation
For Software: 
The UI is designed using HTML and CSS with a neon-themed visual style.
Core functionality is implemented in JavaScript.
User input (attended and missed hours) is used to calculate attendance rate and safe skips in real-time.
Chart.js is used to display attendance visuals dynamically.
Optional components like AI Verdict and Excuse Generator add decision hints and entertainment.
The website operates entirely on the frontend, with no backend or database dependencies.

Displays attendance rate, hours attended/missed, safe skips, and required minimum in a neon-themed panel with a progress ring and threshold bar to visually track compliance with 75% attendance rule.

Allows users to log missed hours with date input. Updates total attendance using the formula:
attendance = (hrs_attended / total_hrs) √ó 100, ensuring real-time tracking after each missed entry.

AI.VERDICT warns when attendance is critically low, advising caution.
EXCUSE.GEN humorously generates random excuses (like family emergencies) for missed classes. Includes options for new excuses and access to silly usage statistics.
